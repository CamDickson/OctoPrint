<h1>OctoPrint - 3D Printer Control Software </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Connected OctoPrint for my Ender 3S1, a network-based software tool that allows me to remotely control my 3D printer using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. I also attached a camera letting me create timelapse of my prints and remotely watch the printer while away from home. I have always wanted to do this project, finally after getting some free time I have it setup and couldnt be happier. I find being able to start prints remotely very neat and the vast amount of plugins avaible for OctoPrint will give me lots to experiment with.
